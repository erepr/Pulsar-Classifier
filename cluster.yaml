# note: your cortex cluster uses this bucket for metadata storage, and it should not be accessed directly (a separate bucket should be used for your models)

# list of availability zones for your region (default: 3 random availability zones from the specified region)

# whether the subnets used for EC2 instances should be public or private (default: "public")
# if "public", instances will be assigned public IP addresses; if "private", instances won't have public IPs and a NAT gateway will be created to allow outgoing network requests
# see https://docs.cortex.dev/v/0.18/miscellaneous/security#private-cluster for more information
subnet_visibility: public  # must be "public" or "private"

# whether to include a NAT gateway with the cluster (a NAT gateway is necessary when using private subnets)
# default value is "none" if subnet_visibility is set to "public"; "single" if subnet_visibility is "private"
nat_gateway: none  # must be "none", "single", or "highly_available" (highly_available means one NAT gateway per availability zone)

# whether the API load balancer should be internet-facing or internal (default: "internet-facing")
# note: if using "internal", APIs will still be accessible via the public API Gateway endpoint unless you also disable API Gateway in your API's configuration (if you do that, you must configure VPC Peering to connect to your APIs)
# see https://docs.cortex.dev/v/0.18/miscellaneous/security#private-cluster for more information

# whether the operator load balancer should be internet-facing or internal (default: "internet-facing")
# note: if using "internal", you must configure VPC Peering to connect your CLI to your cluster operator (https://docs.cortex.dev/v/0.18/guides/vpc-peering)
# see https://docs.cortex.dev/v/0.18/miscellaneous/security#private-cluster for more information
